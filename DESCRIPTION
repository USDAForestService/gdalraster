Title: Bindings to the 'Geospatial Data Abstraction Library' Raster API
Version: 1.1.0
Description: Interface to the raster API of the 'Geospatial Data Abstraction 
	Library' ('GDAL') supporting manual creation of uninitialized datasets, 
	creation from existing raster as template, low level I/O,  
	configuration of virtual raster (VRT), coordinate transformation, and 
	access to 'gdalwarp' for reprojection. Convenience functions are provided 
	for working with spatial reference systems. Calling signatures resemble 
	the native C, C++ and Python APIs provided by the 'GDAL' project 
	(<https://gdal.org>). Bindings to 'GDAL' are implemented in class 
	'GDALRaster' along with several stand-alone functions. 
	Additional functionality includes: class 'RunningStats' for efficient 
	summary statistics on a data stream; class 'CmbTable' for counting unique 
	combinations of integer values with a hash table; a raster overlay utility 
	to identify and count unique combinations across multiple inputs; and a 
	raster calculation utility to evaluate an R expression on raster layers   
	with pixel coordinates also available as variables. 'gdalraster' is a 
	fast, lightweight and modern interface to 'GDAL'. It may be suitable for 
	applications that primarily need low-level raster I/O, explicit 
	manipulation of VRT format, or prefer native 'GDAL'-like calling. The 
	additional functionality is somewhat aimed at thematic data analysis but 
	may have other utility.
