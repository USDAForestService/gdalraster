Description: Interface to the raster API of the 'Geospatial Data Abstraction
    Library' ('GDAL') supporting manual creation of uninitialized datasets,
    creation from existing raster as template, low level I/O, configuration of
    virtual raster (VRT), coordinate transformation, and access to 'gdalwarp'
    for reprojection. Convenience functions facilitate working with spatial
    reference systems. Calling signatures resemble the native C, C++ and
    Python APIs provided by the 'GDAL' project (<https://gdal.org>).
    Bindings to 'GDAL' are implemented in class 'GDALRaster' along with
    several stand-alone functions. Additional functionality includes: class
    'RunningStats' for efficient summary statistics on large data streams;
    class 'CmbTable' for counting unique combinations of integer values with a
    hash table; a raster overlay utility to identify and count unique
    combinations across multiple inputs; and a calculation utility for
    evaluating an R expression on raster layers with pixel coordinates
    available as variables. 'gdalraster' may be suitable for applications that
    primarily need low-level raster I/O, explicit manipulation of VRT format,
    or prefer native 'GDAL'-like calling. Additional functionality is somewhat
    aimed at thematic data analysis but may have other utility.
