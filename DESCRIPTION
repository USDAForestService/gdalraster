Title: Bindings to the 'Geospatial Data Abstraction Library' Raster API
Version: 1.1.0
Author: Chris Toney
Maintainer: Chris Toney <chris.toney@usda.gov>
Description: Interface to the raster API of the 'Geospatial Data Abstraction 
	Library' ('GDAL') supporting manual creation of uninitialized datasets, 
	creation from existing raster as template, low level I/O,  
	configuration of virtual raster (VRT) format, and access to 'gdalwarp' 
	for reprojection. Calling signatures resemble the native C, C++ and Python 
	APIs provided by the 'GDAL' project (<https://gdal.org>). Bindings to 'GDAL' 
	are implemented in class 'GDALRaster' along with several stand-alone 
	functions. Additional functionality supports scalable processing: class 
	'RunningStats' for efficient summary statistics on a data stream, class 
	'CmbTable' for counting unique combinations of integer values with a hash 
	table, and raster overlay utility to identify and count unique 
	combinations across multiple inputs. 'gdalraster' is a fast, lightweight 
	and modern interface to 'GDAL'. It may be suitable for applications that 
	primarily need low-level raster I/O or explicit manipulation of VRT format,
	or prefer native 'GDAL'-like calling.
